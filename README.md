# Machine Learning Techniques to Detect Fraudulent Credit Card Transactions
As the technology is growing usage of credit cards is growing it results in higher unauthorized
usage of these cards. Using the latest technology, fraudsters are committing more and more
frauds and making these frauds look as legit as possible. To control these frauds, and tackle the
fraudsters' unpredictable behaviors we should use the latest and accurate technologies. Machine
Learning provides a great solution in detecting anomalies in data. Which assures an accurate
solution to this problem. So analyzing and using a large set of credit card transactions dataset we
can build various machine learning techniques to detect these frauds. In this project, We have
trained and built five machine learning models to find unusual behaviors of fraudsters and detect
fraudulent credit card transactions using transaction data of European Union customers. These
models will be useful to detect a fraudulent transaction as soon as it takes place. It helps banks
and financial institutions to stop such transactions even before authorizing them, which is
expected to save a lot of resources and money for banks & financial Institutions. Machine
learning models like Logistic regression, Random forest, Support Vector Machine, Artificial
Neural Networks, and Decision Trees have been built in this Project. All the mentioned models
gave excellent results in detecting credit card fraud transactions. The performance of these
models has been evaluated using different metrics. Among these models, the ANN model has
given the highest accuracy of 99.8% and Precision of 99.76% with a lowest False Positive rate of
0.11%, So ANN can be used for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions.
